# Rock-Paper-scissors-spock-lizard
Rock paper scissors is a classic game which has evolved some new additional moves over the years. It was origonally played between two people who used there hands to display the move they where making at the same time as the eachother. It originated in china and dates back to the chinese han dynasty. It is essentially in the same area as a coin toss or drawing straws as a method of choosing between two people. Over the years various iterations have developed which added more moves to the game creating a more complex playing experience. We have added one new iteration to this game which adds 2 extra moves **Spock** and **Lizard** which reduces the chance of the round ending in a draw.

Welcome to my game [Rock Paper Scissors](https://rl33-glitch.github.io/rock-paper-scissor/)

# Features

The Rock Paper Scissors site was developed to provide a fun experience when you have a small amount of time to kill. The site layout is simple with a retro pixalated feel to it. It is a nod to the arcade experience and has the same consistency through the look and feel of the webpages structure across all pages and breakpoints.


# Homepage

- You are presented with a rock paper scissors logo as your first point of contact with the page.
- Then we have the classic game mode which will lead the player to a classic version of the game with 3 move options.
- Under this we have the mayhem game mode which adds 2 extra moves to the players options which increases complexity and adds a more modern twist to the game.
- We are then presented with a how to play option which will take the user to a screen showing each moves strengths and weaknesses to give the player a guide on what moves will win and loose or draw.
